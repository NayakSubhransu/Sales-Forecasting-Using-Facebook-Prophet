#  Sales Forecasting Using Facebook Prophet

##  **Overview**

This project focuses on **predicting future daily sales** across **1,115 retail stores** using **AI-driven time series forecasting**.
The goal is to enable the sales department to make **data-driven decisions** in **inventory management**, **staff planning**, and **promotion optimization**.

The model leverages **Facebook Prophet**, an open-source forecasting tool developed by **Metaâ€™s Core Data Science team**, which excels at capturing **seasonal patterns, trends, holidays, and promotions**.

---

##  **Objective**

To develop a **predictive model** that accurately forecasts **daily store sales** by incorporating:

* Seasonality (weekly, monthly, yearly)
* Promotional campaigns
* State and school holidays
* Competitive store presence

This allows the business to:

* Anticipate sales fluctuations,
* Optimize stock and resources,
* Improve marketing and promotional timing.

##  **Dataset Description**

The dataset consists of **two files**:

1. **`train.csv`** â€“ Historical daily sales data
2. **`store.csv`** â€“ Metadata about each store

| **Feature**                    | **Description**                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `Store`                        | Unique store ID                                      |
| `Date`                         | Date of observation                                  |
| `Sales`                        | Target variable â€“ daily total sales                  |
| `Customers`                    | Number of customers on a given day                   |
| `Open`                         | Whether the store was open (1) or closed (0)         |
| `Promo`                        | Whether a store ran a promotion that day             |
| `StateHoliday`                 | Public/Easter/Christmas holidays (a, b, c, 0)        |
| `SchoolHoliday`                | Whether school closures affected sales               |
| `StoreType`                    | Type of store (aâ€“d)                                  |
| `Assortment`                   | Level of product variety (aâ€“c)                       |
| `CompetitionDistance`          | Distance to nearest competitor                       |
| `Promo2`                       | Whether a store participates in continuous promotion |
| `Promo2Since`, `PromoInterval` | Start date and frequency of recurring promotions     |

---

##  **Technical Approach**

###  Data Preprocessing

* Handled missing values and duplicates.
* Replaced nulls in `CompetitionDistance` with mean values.
* Encoded categorical features (`StateHoliday`, `StoreType`, `Assortment`).
* Filtered only **open stores** (`Open == 1`).
* Created new **temporal features**:
  `Year`, `Month`, `Day`, `DayOfWeek`, `Quarter`, `IsWeekend`.

###  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Visualized **sales and customer distributions**.
* Analyzed **monthly** and **weekly sales trends**.
* Generated **correlation heatmaps** for numeric variables.
* Identified clear **seasonality patterns** and **promo-driven spikes**.

###  Forecasting Model â€“ Facebook Prophet

* Built store-specific models using Prophetâ€™s **additive regression** approach:
<img width="758" height="273" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12b88b1a-e4e3-4146-aac6-e64babbc7f50" />


* Used Prophet parameters:

  ```python
  Prophet(
      yearly_seasonality=True,
      weekly_seasonality=True,
      daily_seasonality=False,
      changepoint_prior_scale=0.1
  )
  ```

* Integrated **custom holidays** (state and school holidays).

* Forecasted future sales for **60 days** per store.

###  Model Evaluation

Used three core metrics:

| Metric   | Description                    |
| -------- | ------------------------------ |
| **MAE**  | Mean Absolute Error            |
| **RMSE** | Root Mean Squared Error        |
| **MAPE** | Mean Absolute Percentage Error |

Example:

```python
MAE: 420.55, RMSE: 560.14, MAPE: 9.32%
```

This indicates <10% average forecast error â€” excellent for retail forecasting.

###  Cross-Validation

* Applied **rolling-origin cross-validation** using Prophetâ€™s built-in diagnostics:

  ```python
  df_cv = cross_validation(model, initial='365 days', period='90 days', horizon='180 days')
  ```
* Visualized forecast error trends with Plotly (`MAPE vs Horizon`).

###  Baseline Model Comparison

* Built a **30-day moving average** model as a benchmark.
* Prophet outperformed the baseline, demonstrating better adaptability to trends and holidays.
